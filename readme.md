in this project, we are using openai's vision api to analyze the contract and template pdfs and apply matching strikethrough formatting to the contract document.

this is step 1 of having the contract match the template. I am still having issues with the contract not matching the template exactly. 

once this is working consistently, I will work on adding the matching comments from the template to the contract. 

i have tried to one shot this process, but the vision api is not yet capable of this. currently working on trying the conversion to JSON process you recommended. 

best,

-Javier

ps. I have attached the necessary installs to have the project running in the requirements.txt file.
